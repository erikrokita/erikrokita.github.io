//I believe that for github is the best platform for keeping articles because it is easy for<br/>
//programmers to use and learn, and things like making new pages, commits, updates, editing, and all of that stuff<br/>
//is listed in the help page for when you need assistance. Everything is all in one place and there is<br/>
//no need to trample around trying to find everything. Not to mention that it's free, and you can make unlimited pages!<br/>
